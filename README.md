# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Analysis (SQL Project)

This project simulates real-world healthcare analytics using SQL, similar to how Cotiviti handles claims and patient risk scoring.

## 📊 Dataset:
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadehsan02/diabetes-patient-health-data)
- Patients: 768
- Columns: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Diabetes

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- MySQL
- Excel (optional Power BI and VBA)

## 🔍 Key Queries:
- Diabetes count by age group
- BMI/Glucose risk flagging
- Hereditary risk scores
- Data quality checks
- Risk segmentation

## 🧠 Insights:
- High BMI and glucose strongly link to diabetes
- 34% of patients over 50 show high hereditary risk
- Zero insulin with high glucose = potential anomaly

## 📄 Report Included:
- SQL_Report.md
